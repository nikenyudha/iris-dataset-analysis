# iris-dataset-analysis

📋 Project Overview

This project explores the famous Iris Dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal of this project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and extract meaningful insights.

📊 Dataset Information

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

🔎 Objective

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

Visualize the data to understand feature distributions and relationships.

Identify patterns and insights through EDA.

🛠️ Tools Used : Python, Pandas, Matplotlib / Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
The following analyses were conducted:
- 🌸 Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, data types, etc.
- 🌸Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics for each feature.
- 🌸Visualizations:
   - Pairplots to visualize feature relationships.
   - Boxplots to detect outliers.
   - Correlation heatmaps to understand feature dependencies.

🔬 Key Insights

- 🌸Setosa species has smaller petal and sepal dimensions compared to other species, making it easier to distinguish.
- 🌸Versicolor and Virginica show some overlap in their feature distributions, particularly in petal length and width.
- 🌸The strongest correlation was observed between petal_length and petal_width.
